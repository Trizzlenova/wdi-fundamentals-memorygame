      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of
      the cards are laid faced down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs
      of matching cards.</p>

      <h2>Why Memory is fun</h2>
      <p>Memory is a great way to test how well you're able to focus during gameplay. You test out your concentration skills and, like with everything else, gets better with repetition.
